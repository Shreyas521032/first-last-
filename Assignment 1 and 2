ASSIGNMENT 1:

Week 1: Problem Statement & Service Layer

To meet the one-month deadline for developing the shopping cart system, the entire process must be significantly accelerated.
The first week focuses on both the problem statement and service layer planning. The project begins with defining the primary goal
and gathering initial requirements from stakeholders within the first few days. These requirements outline the basic functionalities
of the system and the problems it aims to solve for both the business and its customers. The latter part of the week is dedicated
to planning the system's architecture, including the design of user interaction flows, data flow mapping, and selecting the appropriate
communication protocols for secure and efficient data transfer.

Week 2: Development - Planning & Design

In the second week, the focus shifts to detailed planning and design. This involves finalizing the requirements and creating wireframes
for the user interface, along with designing the database structure and API endpoints. The development environment is also set up during this time,
with version control established using Git and GitHub. By mid-week, initial development begins, laying the foundation for both front-end 
and back-end components. Integration points between the front-end, built using React.js with Redux, and the back-end, developed with Node.js
and Express.js, are established to ensure seamless communication between the system's components.

Week 3: Development - Implementation & Integration

The third week is dedicated to the full-scale implementation and integration of the system. The front-end features are developed using React.js
with Redux, while the back-end logic, including API creation with Express.js and MongoDB integration, is implemented. JWT is incorporated for
secure user authentication. By the end of the week, the front-end and back-end are integrated, and initial testing is conducted to identify and
address any critical issues, ensuring the system functions as intended.

Week 4: Testing, Refinement, & Launch

In the final week, the focus is on thorough testing, refinement, and the deployment of the system. Rigorous testing is performed to check functionality,
performance, and security, with any identified issues being resolved promptly. Once the system is optimized, it is deployed on a live server,
followed by a brief soft launch to gather final feedback and make last-minute adjustments. The public launch is then carried out, with the team transitioning
to ongoing maintenance and updates based on user feedback, ensuring continuous improvement and system reliability.
